Several indicators are currently available :&#x20;

* **Treasury** : the current amount of tokens and their values in the Treasury
* **Governance** : the total number of Shares (1 share = 1 right on Treasury assets + 1 voting right) & the total number of Loots (1 loot = 1 right on Treasury assets without voting right)
* **Whitelist** : the list of whitelisted tokens
* **Members** : the list of member addresses & their roles (currently Admin OR Member)

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, only ERC-20 tokens can be managed by the Treasury. ERC-721 tokens are yet to be implemented.
