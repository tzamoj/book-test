# Why a port of Moloch V2

During our assessment phase of the exsiting DAO Frameworks, we identitied Moloch V2 as covering a major part of our needs.

Moreover, the minimalist design of Moloch V2 minimizes the risk of regressions or side effects while adding or tweaking functionnalities.

Once the MVP live, we may add further functionnalities included in Moloch V3 such as (i) tokenization of the Shares, (ii) ability to interact with AMMs or a multisig contract to mange the Treasury.
