# Moloch overview

Moloch is an open-source DAO framework, originally designed to manage Grants: when new members join the DAO they receive non transferable shares in exchange of wETH allocated to the DAO treasury. Shares represent voting rights on proposals (mainly membership applications and grants allocations).

Based on the same principles, Moloch V2 has extended its initial set of functionalities to allow the roll-out of Profit DAOs able invest in an unlimited portfolio of assets. The V2 upgrade mainly included multi-Token support, the possibility to expel a member and non-voting shares issuance.
