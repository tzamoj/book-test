## Role-based membership system <a href="#markdown-header-members" id="markdown-header-members"></a>

MolochX DAO uses a role-based membership system. Members are assigned roles, hence a different set of rights  per type of proposal.

The first version includes 3 roles :

1. Administrator: responsible for onboarding new members and whitelisting assets
2. Governor: responsible for the governance of the assets.
3. Guild Member : responsible for the management of the Bank assets

The V1 will allow to define any set of roles.

## Proposal custom settings

Each proposal type can be customized with a set of parameters&#x20;
