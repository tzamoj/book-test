# ðŸ’  Why a port on Starknet

Our targeted end-users are not all crypto-natives. Hence, we want to rely on **Social Recovery Wallets** to mitigate the risk of loss of access to Wallets while still relying on a Self Custody paradigm.

Although these features are live on Ethereum and EVM Layers 2, their implementations are not native and require additional Smart Contracts like Gnosis Safe's Multisig Wallets. This leads to extra complexity for the end-user as well as increased gas fees.

In contrast, **Account Abstraction** is native to Starknet. End-users can use wallets like [ArgentX](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/) or [Braavos ](https://braavos.app/)that include Social Recovery features.&#x20;
