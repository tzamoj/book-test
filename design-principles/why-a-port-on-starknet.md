# ðŸ’  Why a port on Starknet

Our targeted end-users are not all crypto-natives. Hence, we want to rely on Social Recovery Wallets to mitigate the risk of loss of access to Wallets while still relying on a Self Custody paradigm.

These features are live on Ethereum and EVM Layers 2 with the use of Multisig Wallets like Gnosis Safe. However, as they are implemented through Smart Contracts it can lead to increased fees and complexity for the end-user.

Account Abstraction on Starknet will allow us to leverage on Social Recovery features which will be directly included in user Wallets like Argent X or Braavos.
