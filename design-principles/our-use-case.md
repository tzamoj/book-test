# Our Use Case

We aim to implement a profit sharing fund for Quadratic Employees with the following features:

* The firm is allocating a part of its profits or investments to the fund, following a classical incentivization scheme
* The shares of the fund are allocated to our Employees accordingly to peer-to-peer assessment ; we introduce peer-to-peer assesment mecanisms in order to mitigate the biases involved by top down management assessment
* The investments made by the fund are decided by the shareholders through the vote of proposals&#x20;
* Functions potentially involving the accountability of the firm are triggered by the Admins of the fund (e.g. whitelisting of assets tradables by the fund)
* Shareholders can redeem their shares at any time

The roll-out of this fund is scheduled for Q2 2023, based on the results of fiscal year 2022.

The technical implementation of these features relies on a DAO Framework in order to:

* Leverage on Decentralized Goverance features
*
