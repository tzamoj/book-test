# Our Use Case

We aim to implement a profit sharing fund for Quadratic Employees with the following features:

* The group is allocating a part of its profits or investments to the fund, following a classical incentivization scheme
* The shares of the fund are allocated to the employees accordingly to peer-to-peer assessment)°; we introduce peer-to-peer assesment mecanisms in order to mitigate the biases involved by top down management assessment
* The investments made by the fund are votes by the shareholders through the vote of proposals
