# Our Use Case

We aim to implement a profit sharing fund for Quadratic Employees with the following features:

* The group is allocating a part of its profits or investments to the fund, follwing a classical incentivization scheme
* The shares of the fund are allocated to the employees accordingly to peer-to-peer assessment ; we introcuce peer-to-peer assesment mecanisms in order to mitigate the bias involved by top down management assessment
*
