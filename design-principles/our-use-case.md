# Our Use Case

We aim to implement a profit sharing tokenized fund for Quadratic Employees with the following features:

* The group is allocating a part of its profits or investments to the fund, following a classical incentivization scheme
* The shares of the fund are allocated to the employees accordingly to peer-to-peer assessment ; we introduce peer-to-peer assesment mecanisms in order to mitigate the biases involved by top down management assessment
* The investments made by the fund are voted by the shareholders through the vote of proposals
* Funtions potentially involving the accountability of the Group are trigerred by the Admins (e.g. whitelisting)
* Shareholders can redeem their shares at any time

The roll-out of this find is scheduled for Q2 2023, based on the results of fiscal year 2022.
