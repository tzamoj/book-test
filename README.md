# Introduction

**Moloch X** is a DAO Framework, implementing most of **Moloch V2** features, adding new functionalities to provide more flexibility for Roles & Proposals management and running on Starknet.

As it has been developed to allow the roll-out of Quadratic Employees Profit Sharing Fund, it meets the following requirements:

* Deployment on Starknet to (i) lower the amount of gas fees needed to submit a proposal or a vote (ii) rely on Wallets implemeting Social Recovery features as some of the targeted end-users are not crypto-natives
* Ability to fine-tune the Proposals Management and the Voting Rules in order to be able to (i) manage externally defined criterias (e.g. Membership) (ii) set-up the right set of parameters to align Voting Rights & Accountability (e.g. Whitelisting)
