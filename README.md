# ðŸ”¹ Introduction

**Moloch on Starknet** is a MVP, implementing most of **Moloch V2** features, adding new functionalities to provide more flexibility for roles & proposals management and running on **Starknet**.

It has been designed in order to facilitate a roll-out in a Corporate environnement, with the ability to:

* **Onboard end-users who are not crypto-natives**, leveraging on Wallets implementing social recovery features
* **Fine-tune the proposals management and the voting rules** in order to be able to (i) enforce externally defined criterias (e.g. membership) (ii) set-up the right set of parameters to align voting rights & accountability (e.g. whitelisting)

Alpha Version is under developemnt and fits Quadratic internal Use Case (setup of an Employees profit sharing fund) and will be rolled-out at Starknet regenesis.&#x20;
